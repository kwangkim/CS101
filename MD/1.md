### Grading

**No make up quiz, project, exam**.

- a. Class exam(30%):TEST 1, TEST2, TEST3

- b. LAB(45%)
 - LAB QUIZ(6%): 3 quizzes (+ 1 Extra quiz)
 - LAB TEST(27%): 3 coding tests.
 - LAB PROJECT(12%): 3 personal projects + 1 team project

- c. **Final**(25%)- regular Test(13%) + Coding test(12%)


**I will replace one of lowest scores of class TEST1, 2, 3 if final regular score is higher.**

**I will replace one of lowest scores of coding TEST 1, 2, 3 if final coding score is higher.**

### Recommandation
- Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition) by B Stroustrup. ISBN: 978-0321992789

- C++ Primer. 5th Edition by S Lippman. ISBN: 978-0321714114

- The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition) by B Stroustrup.   ISBN 978-0321563842

-----------------

### **Attendance Policy**

> - Unexcused absences beyond 15% of course hours(**6 days**)=> F.

> - To excuse your absences, a **proper document with early notice** is necessary.

> - Two late marks count as one absence.

> - If students leave early without early notice, I will consider as one late mark.

----------------

### No SNS and phone policy

- Please, silence your cellphone and other electronic devices. 

- Except early notice, do not use SNS or phone.

- **For the quiz and test, students should turn off their electronic devices and put them in their bag to avoid a failing grade for the quiz, or test.**

---------

### Comments

- A good Programmer may not get a better grade in class.

- Come on time.

- Submit your project on time. (No late submission.)

- Read the TEXTBOOK!

- No Make up Quiz and Test!

- Practice again at home.

---------------

### Goal

In this course, we will study

> - How to identify problems
> - How to make algorithms to solve the problems
> - How to implement algorithms using c++

## Declarative vs Imperative

--------------

### Declarative Knowledge - What

Declarative knowledge is composed of statements of fact.

EX: “y is the square root of x if and only if y*y = x”

-------------

### Imperative Knowledge - How

Imperative knowledge is about how to accomplish something. Think
of it as a recipe.

> - 1. Start with a guess, g.
<br>
> - 2. If g*g is close enough to x,

> - => g is a good approximation of the square root of x
<br>
> - 3. Otherwise, create a new guess by averaging g and x/g.
I.e., gnew = (g_old + x/g_old)/2
<br>
> - 4. Using this new guess, go back to step 2

-------------

### Think like a programmer

> - Computer can do only what you tell them.
<br>
<br>

> - <h3>Data(Information) + Code(Instruction)</h3>
<br>
<br>
> - Computer needs more specific (logical) commands.

------------------


### Think like a programmer : Example

EX. “Convert a number from Celsius to Fahrenheit for me.” implies

> - 1. Print the “Enter Celsius temperature:” message. (OUTPUT)

> - 2. Get a number from the keyboard and store it in the variable
ctemp. (INPUT)

> - 3. Convert to Fahrenheit by using the formula ftemp = 32+(ctemp * 1.8). (CALC)

> - 4. Print the “The Fahrenheit temperature is:” message. (OUTPUT)

> - 5. Print the value of the variable ftemp. (OUTPUT)

------------------

### Story on C++

- Machine code – CPU’s native language. Consists of 1s and 0s. Very difficult to write.

- High Level language - a computer programming
language that resembles natural language or mathematical notation.
EX. Fortran, Basic, C, C++, Pascal, Java,...

- C: Dennis Ritchie originally designed C for help in writing operating
systems(UNIX). C imposes fewer restrictions than other languages do

- C++: created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ adds the ability to do
object-oriented (data centric) programming.
Data, operations for Data, interaction between data objects.

----------------------------------

### Building a C++ program

- 1. . Enter the Program statements. Integrated development environment (IDE) a text editor combined with other helpful programming tools.

- 2. . Building the Program. (Compile and Link)
To build successfully, check syntax errors.

- Actual process is more complicated. C++ usually uses **pre-processor** to modify source codes.
